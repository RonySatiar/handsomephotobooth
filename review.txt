We are beyond thrilled with the experience and services we received from Handsome Photo Booth! Not only that but the quality of the photos and props were amazing. Our guests could not stop raving about how amazing the photo booth was - they loved the photos and set ups! I have friends already framing the photos because they're THAT good! Thank you for being flexible and accommodating my requested style, it really brought everything together! I highly recommend working with Leo and don't hesitate to share your vision as he was so flexible to accommodate mine! All our photos were done on a crisp white backdrop all printed in 4x6" prints in black and white! I will cherish these photos for years to come!
